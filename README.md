# PD | CLI

This is a simple CSV parsing and query CLI written in 8th.

## Dependencies

This app uses several words I've created as share in my own collection of [8th libraries][libs]. Simply clone that repo into your `$EIGHTHLIB/libs` to make use of them.

## Quickstart

Try `pd --help` or see the [usage file][usage] in source control.
